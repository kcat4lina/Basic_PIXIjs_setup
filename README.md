# Basic PixiJS 7.4.0 Setup with TypeScript and Webpack

This project demonstrates a basic setup for PixiJS 7.4.0 using TypeScript and Webpack. It provides a simple starting point for creating interactive graphics and games with PixiJS.

## Features

- PixiJS 7.4.0
- TypeScript support
- Webpack for bundling

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234`

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:
```npm run build```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.

To run the application:
```npm run start```

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point of the application
- `src/index.ejs`: HTML template
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration

## EJS Templating

This project uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for HTML templating. EJS allows you to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript, offering several advantages:

1. Dynamic content injection: Easily incorporate dynamic content into your HTML.
2. JavaScript logic: Use JavaScript directly within your template for conditional rendering or looping.
3. Modular structure: Supports includes and partials for reusable components.
4. Webpack integration: Works seamlessly with webpack's asset management and bundling.

Using EJS provides more flexibility and power in structuring the PixiJS application's entry point (src/index.ts).
